# learning_site
This is a learning site built using Python's popular Django web framework. 

This project allows admins to create courses, add steps to the courses, and create quizzes. Students can then take the courses.

Since I've been trying to learn how to properly design a large web project I haven't touched this in a while.

Todo:
Add more testing
Add ability for users actually take the quizzes
Add a slide show step.  User would view slide show then take a test on the contents of the presentation.
